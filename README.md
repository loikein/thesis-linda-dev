# Template for thesis projects

This is a template for thesis projects at the [OpenSourceEconomics](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics) research group.

### Inquiry

Thank you for your interest in writing your thesis at our research group. Please submit a copy of your curriculum vitae and transcript of records and describe your programming experience. In addition, please provide a brief description of your research interest and how they relate to our group's existing work. Please send the complete material to [Simone Jost-Mussehl](https://www.iame.uni-bonn.de/people/jost-mussehl). We will then get back to you within one week.

## Programming

All thesis projects involve extensive [Python](https://www.python.org) programming. Please see the [Scipy Lecture Notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/) for a gentle introduction to the science stack. [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) and  [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm) offer convenient development environments for your project.

### Version control

Please sign up for a [GitHub Account](http://github.com). For grading purposes you will hand in all your thesis material using a repository. All this only in addition to the procedure required by the university. [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client) is a great Git client and also provides useful tutorials on their website,

#### Continuous integration

To ensure full reproducibility of your project, please set up a [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) as your continuous integration service. This includes the compilation of the final PDF as well as the codes that create the material used there.
